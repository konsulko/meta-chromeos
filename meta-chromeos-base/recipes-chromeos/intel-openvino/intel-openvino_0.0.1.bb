# 2. Extra arguments that should be added to EXTRA_OECONF or PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS if the feature is disabled.
# 3. Additional build dependencies (DEPENDS) that should be added if the feature is enabled.
# 4. Additional runtime dependencies (RDEPENDS) that should be added if the feature is enabled.
# 5. Additional runtime recommendations (RRECOMMENDS) that should be added if the feature is enabled.
